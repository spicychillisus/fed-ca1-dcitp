        <h2 id="personal_opinion">My personal opinion on what we can do</h2>
        <p>There are so much that we can do to help in saving our earth. But first, let's go over the facts.</p>
        <p>The earth's climate changes everyday due to
        burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and other industrial processes. 
        Fossil fuels are burned in order to create energy for vehicles to run, deforestation happens to clear spaces for 
        developments by burning down the trees, producing smoke, and industrial processes pollute the air. Such activities can lead to temperatures increasing, melting glaciers, sea-level rise,
    and more frequent natural disasters such as floods and draughts. This is what is known as <b>Climate Change.</b></p>

        <p>My personal opinion on what we can do in saving the earth is that we can try to educate others on the importance of sustainability
            and how they can help to create a positive impact on the environment. By doing so, more people will be educated on the importance of
            sustainability on earth and more measures can be taken to reduce the risk of climate change and make our earth a much better place
            to live in.

        <h2>Other Measures</h2>
        <p>A YouTuber by the name of MrBeast started initiatives to help in saving the earth,
            named #TEAMTREES and #TEAMSEAS. 
        </p>
        <img src="../photos/teamtrees.jpg" alt="teamtrees" id="teamtrees">
        <p>
            The #TEAMTREES campaign was started in 2019. The goal of the campaign was to raise funds to
            plant 20 million trees by the end of 2019. It gained widespread attention and support from  
            the online community. Donations were made through the #TEAMTREES website, with every dollar contributing 
            to planting one tree. The campaign successfully reached it's target by the end of 2019.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the success of #TEAMTREES, another campaign was started, named #TEAMSEAS. The goal was to remove
            30 million pounds of platic and debris from the world's oceans. MrBeast partnered with The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit 
            organisation dedicated to developing technologies to removing plastic waste from the oceans. The campaign also aimed to raise funds
            through donations to support cleanup efforts. It received worldwide support, and funds raised were used to develop technologies
            for effective ocean cleaup.

                <h2>Goal 1: Reducing Waste</h2>
                <p>My first personal goal is to reduce the amount of waste I produce. 
                I plan to use reusable containers and water bottles, as well as avoid using single-use plastics like straws and bags, 
                compost food waste, and recycle properly. To do so, I will buy products made from sustainable materials, 
                such as recycled paper or bamboo, to reduce waste in the long term.</p>

                <h2>Goal 2: Using sustainable transportation</h2>
                <p>Although this is something that many of us do on a daily basis, mainly because it's part of the norm,
                my next personal goal is to use sustainable transportation, which means that instead of using vehicles that
                run on diesel, I will try and opt for eco-friendly vehicles that run on clean natural gas or electricity. These
                kind of vehicles don't pollute the environment as they are much more cleaner to run.</p>

            <article>
                <img src="../icons/recycle.png" alt="recycle" id="recycle">
                <h2>Goal 3: Reuse, Reduce, Recycle</h2>
                <p>The 3Rs, Reuse, Reduce and Recycle promote sustainable practices that reduces the environmental impact
                    in our daily lives.</p> 
                    <p>Reduce refers to reducing the amount of waste that we create. We can do so by reducing the 
                    amount of resources that we use by buying what we need and avoiding single-use items.</p>
                    <p>Reuse refers to using products or materials that have already been used and using them again instead of 
                        disposing them away after single use. I'm already starting to do this but I will reuse plastic shopping bags
                        from NTUC instead of throwing them away and reuse them for other uses such as carrying spare clothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>Recycle refers to converting old waste materials into new products, reducing the need to extract raw materials
                        to make new materials. Items like paper, and plastic can all be recycled to form new products.
                    </p>

                    <p>Using the 3Rs, it will help to create a more sustainable earth to live in for all.</p>
